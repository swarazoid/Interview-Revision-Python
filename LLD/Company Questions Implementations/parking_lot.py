# POST /checkin/
# - Check in a car and assign a parking space.
# - Request body: { "car_id": "string" }
# - Response: { "ticket_id": "string", "space_id": "string" }

# POST /checkout/
# - Check out a car using the ticket ID.
# - Request body: { "ticket_id": "string" }
# - Response: { "message": "Car checked out successfully." }

# GET /spaces/
# - Get the count of available parking spaces for a given car size.
# - Query parameter: size=Small/Medium/Large
# - Response: { "size": "string", "available_spaces": "integer" }

# GET /tickets/{ticket_id}/
# - Get details of a specific parking ticket.
# - Path parameter: ticket_id
# - Response: { "ticket_id": "string", "car_id": "string", "space_id": "string", "issued_at": "string", "checked_out_at": "string" }

# GET /report/
# - Get a report of parking lot status (e.g., available spaces, occupied spaces).

# ### **Database Schema**
# 1. **Cars Table**
#    - `car_id` (Primary Key): Unique identifier for a car.
#    - `size` (Enum): Size of the car (Small, Medium, Large).

# 2. **ParkingSpaces Table**
#    - `space_id` (Primary Key): Unique identifier for a parking space.
#    - `size` (Enum): Size of the parking space (Small, Medium, Large).
#    - `is_occupied` (Boolean): Whether the space is occupied.

# 3. **ParkingTickets Table**
#    - `ticket_id` (Primary Key): Unique identifier for a parking ticket.
#    - `car_id` (Foreign Key): References the `Cars` table.
#    - `space_id` (Foreign Key): References the `ParkingSpaces` table.
#    - `issued_at` (Timestamp): Time when the ticket was issued.
#    - `checked_out_at` (Timestamp): Time when the car was checked out.

# ### **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)**
# - **Cars** table has a one-to-one relationship with **ParkingTickets**.
# - **ParkingSpaces** table has a one-to-one relationship with **ParkingTickets**.
# - The **ParkingTickets** table serves as the linking table for cars and spaces.
